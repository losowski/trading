Prediction Requirements
=======================

1
	Perform all the mathematical calculations on insert of data into the database
2
	Provide a prediction based output
	2.1
		Showing:
			1	-	Date of prediction (and data used)
			2	-	Direction
			3	-	Time by which it is expected
			4	-	Some likelihood indicator based on previous accuracy
	2.2
		prediction to be split into two components.
		2.2.1
			expected price
		2.2.2
			expected time
			
	2.3
		Logic for working out these both will be covered in (prediction_test)
	2.4
		Logic for defining what constitutes a prediction test (prediction_test_conditions)
3.
	Audit table for the prediction conditions.
	3.1
		Must be triggered to generate on insert, update or delete
